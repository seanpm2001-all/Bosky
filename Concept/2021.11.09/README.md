# Bosky

## Codename 

BRingKERing (BossRing KEyRing)

The project was renamed `Bosky` (lit: shrub) as the original name was overly complicated. I underwent several considerations, such as Gal Capone (but I decided not to, as I don't want to name it after a murderer (Al Capone) even if that murderer is one of the most famous mob **boss**es in history to date) and Boss Keyring. The name was simplified to bosky, and the 3rd name was transferred to the codename position.

## Icon

I figure an icon of a shrub is the best icon for this project. For now, the placeholder icon is the shrub from Clash of Clans, which was the first thing to come to mind when I heard the word shrub on 2021 November 9th. I plan to change it to a green key with a green padlock (with leafy textures) in the future.

## Description

A modern-day Boss Key software tool. Switch instantly from work to play & play to work with Bosky.

## Map key

Options to activate

Insert

SUPER (Windows on Windows operating systems)

DELETE

### When activated

Minimize current active window with no animation

Play video until it is over, or until the set key is pressed again

> Option to loop video indefinitely (loop x times, loop indefinitely (until boss key is pressed again))

## Setup options

Detect operating system

Record video of you working for 30-300 seconds (30 seconds to 5 minutes)

> Export video (export as MP4, WebM, MKV, MOV, AVI, NetV, 3GP, WMV, other)

> Use video (select a video to use for the boss key sequence)

## Boss detect (requires facial recognition)

Images of your face will be stored in the program only and will not have access to an Internet or bluetooth connection, and will be heavily encrypted with 1024 bit encryption (or higher). It will be deleted automatically after 7 days, unless you choose to keep it enabled.

Detects your face. If any other face is seen looking towards you, the boss key will automatically activate

Con1: If your boss gets the ridiculous idea of putting a wallpaper of faces/eyes behind you, you will not be able to use this feature, as it will just not work.

Con2: It may not work if you are wearing a mask or anything else covering your face

> Delete options: (delete after restart/shutdown, delete after x days, don't delete automatically)

## Recommendations

Do not install on a work computer without permission. If you can't get permission, you likely shouldn't be using it to begin with.

Install on your own device that you bring with you.

You deserve to take an unexpected break sometimes, even if your boss doesn't want you to.

Try to still be productive though. The Boss key software is not intended for you to take all of your work time away.

## Programming languages

C (for the general sequences) Python (for boss key activation) C++ (for video exporting)

I want to diversify language usage, so it is going to be written in 3 separate languages.
